classdef PWMController < handle
% PWM Controller provides a helper class to convert analog command signals to digitized impulse bits
% This is important for on / off systems like a binary solenoid valve
% It works by sampling at discrete intervals and comparing to a sawtooth wave
% If the command signal is greater than the sawtooth, turn on
% If the command signal is less than the sawtooth, turn off
% This produces a pwm output that has the similar impulse as the command but with a small phase delay due to sampling
% Keep in mind this doesn't bound the duration of the impulse
